# moqui-assignment-L2

In previous repo, we have defined one entity called Example in helloworld-component. Now in this repo, for same entity we have defined some services for inserting/modifying and deleting data.
These services can be called REST APIs.

This repo only contain component called "helloworld-component" in which definition of one component is mentioned in Example.xml file You need to clone this repo and paste this directory in your-working-directory/moqui-framework/runtime/components/
After that you can run moqui framework as described in docs
